## 1. Project Overview (Non-Technical Summary)

This project simulates the impact of a **20% surge in fares** on rider acceptance and revenue.
Ride requests are split into **control** (baseline fares) and **treatment** (surged fares) groups.

We measure:

* **Elasticity of demand** (how acceptance responds to fare increases)
* **Revenue lift** (whether higher fares offset any reduced acceptance)
* **Segment-level differences** (Airport vs. non-Airport, Peak vs. Off-Peak, Weekend vs. Weekday, Distance bands, Time bands)

**Key finding (summary):** Surge pricing reduces acceptance overall but increases per-request revenue in many segments; the magnitude and sign vary substantially by segment â€” some ride types show net revenue gains, others net revenue loss.

## 3. Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Data Load** â€” Read staged trip-level parquet with `pickup_datetime`, `trip_miles`, `trip_time`, `base_passenger_fare`, `is_airport`, `is_peak`, `is_weekend`, `distance_segment`, `time_segment`, etc. (from the notebook).&#x20;
2. **Experiment Setup** â€” `surge_multiplier = 1.2` applied to treatment group to create `fare_exp`.
3. **Acceptance Model** â€” logistic model: `p_accept = 1 / (1 + exp(alpha*(fare_exp - beta)))` (alpha and beta set in the notebook).
4. **Simulation** â€” Bernoulli draws from `p_accept` to create `accepted`.
5. **Revenue** â€” `revenue = accepted * fare_exp`.
6. **Aggregation & Metrics** â€” For each segment & group compute mean acceptance, mean fare, mean revenue, elasticity (as implemented), revenue difference (`rev_diff`), and sample sizes.
7. **Statistical tests** â€” proportions z-test for acceptance counts and t-test for revenue per request. (Exact outputs included below.)&#x20;

## 4. Results & Interpretation

### A. All-up (Market-level) Summary

* Group-level acceptance rates:

  * **Control** acceptance = **0.5010**
  * **Treatment** acceptance = **0.4261**.&#x20;
* Mean revenue (base fares) by group:

  * `rev_base_fare` â€” control = **5.9731**, treatment = **9.5152**.&#x20;
* Mean revenue (with surged fares):

  * `revenue` â€” control = **5.9731**, treatment = **11.4182**.&#x20;
* Acceptance differences:

  * **Absolute**: **-0.0749** (control â†’ treatment).
  * **Relative**: **-14.94%**.&#x20;
* Fare differences (base / surge):

  * **Base fare difference (abs)** = **3.5421** (â‰ˆ +59.30%).
  * **Surge fare difference (abs)** = **5.4452** (â‰ˆ +91.16%).&#x20;
* **Elasticity (arc method, market level)**: **-0.8878**.&#x20;

**Interpretation (all-up):** The treatment reduces acceptance by \~7.5 percentage points (â‰ˆ15% relatively), while treatment revenue per request increases markedly (â‰ˆ91% higher than control revenue with surge fares). Arc elasticity â‰ˆ âˆ’0.89 indicates moderately elastic response overall â€” price increases reduce acceptance substantially but in this simulation the revenue per-request increase outweighs the average acceptance drop (see t-test below).&#x20;

---

### B. Statistical Tests (market-level)

**Z-Test (acceptance rates)**

* Success counts (accepted) and observations (n): treatment successes = **108,461**, control successes = **127,125**; observations treatment = **254,541**, control = **253,760**.&#x20;
* **Acceptance rate test result**: **z = âˆ’53.515389**, **p = 0.000000**.&#x20;

**Interpretation (z-test):** The very large negative z indicates the treatment acceptance rate is statistically significantly *lower* than control (p â‰ª 0.001). With large sample sizes, even small relative differences become highly significant.

**T-Test (revenue per request)**

* Mean revenue by group (revenue column): control = **5.97**, treatment = **11.42**.&#x20;
* **Revenue test result**: **t = âˆ’165.719**, **p = 0.0000**.&#x20;

**Interpretation (t-test):** The t statistic (very large in magnitude) shows the two groups have statistically different mean revenues per request (tied to the surge). Given p â‰ˆ 0, the difference is highly significant. Note: the t-test compares per-request revenue distributions (not total revenue); with the surge the per-request revenue increases substantially despite lower acceptance.

> Combined reading: acceptance drops are significant (z-test), per-request revenue increases are highly significant (t-test). The business decision depends on whether revenue-per-request gains and accept rate changes translate to net financial goals (total revenue, profitability, retention, downstream effects).

### C. Segment-level Full Tables (copied from notebook outputs)

> All tables below are reproduced from the notebook outputs in the attached HTML notebook export.&#x20;

#### Airport vs Non-Airport

| Metric            | Non-Airport | Airport |
| ----------------- | ----------: | ------: |
| Elasticity        |       -0.69 |   -1.51 |
| Rev\_diff         |        8.13 |   10.23 |
| Accept\_control   |        0.39 |    0.18 |
| Accept\_treatment |        0.35 |    0.14 |
| Fare\_control     |       21.72 |   59.04 |
| Fare\_treatment   |       26.07 |   70.29 |
| Rev\_control      |        8.41 |    0.61 |
| Rev\_treatment    |       16.54 |   10.84 |
| N\_control        |     222,157 | 23,4475 |
| N\_treatment      |     222,824 | 235,257 |

*(Source: notebook output table).*&#x20;

**Interpretation:** Airport rides show much higher price sensitivity (larger negative elasticity) and large fare levels; some airport bands show net revenue gains in the notebook's distance/time breakdowns, but airport vs non-airport at this aggregation has the shown patterns.

---

#### Peak vs Off-Peak

| Metric            | Off-Peak (0) | Peak (1) |
| ----------------- | -----------: | -------: |
| Elasticity        |        -0.55 |    -0.54 |
| Rev\_diff         |         5.84 |     5.22 |
| Accept\_control   |         0.45 |     0.46 |
| Accept\_treatment |         0.40 |     0.41 |
| Fare\_control     |        24.75 |    24.00 |
| Fare\_treatment   |        29.75 |    28.78 |
| Rev\_control      |         5.75 |     6.10 |
| Rev\_treatment    |        11.59 |    11.32 |
| N\_control        |       92,746 |  161,014 |
| N\_treatment      |       92,639 |  161,902 |

*(Source: notebook output table).*&#x20;

**Interpretation:** Both peak and off-peak show positive rev\_diff in the notebook; elasticity magnitudes are similar at this level.

---

#### Weekend vs Weekday

| Metric            | Weekday (0) | Weekend (1) |
| ----------------- | ----------: | ----------: |
| Elasticity        |       -0.55 |       -0.53 |
| Rev\_diff         |        5.45 |        5.43 |
| Accept\_control   |        0.45 |        0.46 |
| Accept\_treatment |        0.41 |        0.42 |
| Fare\_control     |       24.77 |       22.95 |
| Fare\_treatment   |       29.77 |       27.41 |
| Rev\_control      |        5.92 |        6.11 |
| Rev\_treatment    |       11.37 |       11.54 |
| N\_control        |     185,005 |      68,755 |
| N\_treatment      |     185,555 |      68,986 |

*(Source: notebook output table).*

**Interpretation:** Similar rev\_diff and elasticity across weekend/weekdays at this aggregate level.

*(Source: notebook output table).*&#x20;

**Interpretation:** Short trips show revenue loss under surge; medium/long bands often show revenue gains; very long trips have high elasticity but small sample sizes.

## 5. Technical Appendix

* **Acceptance model (notebook)**:

  $$
  p_i = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(\alpha(f_i - \beta))}
  $$

  (Notebook uses `alpha` and `beta` as documented above).&#x20;
* **Elasticity (as computed)**:

  $$
  E = \frac{(\bar{p}_t - \bar{p}_c)/\bar{p}_c}{(\bar{f}_t - \bar{f}_c)/\bar{f}_c}
  $$
* **Statistical tests**:

  * `proportions_ztest(successes, nobs, alternative='smaller')` â†’ z and p printed.&#x20;
